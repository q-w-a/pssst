Functions to fit parametric survival models to survey data to estimate finite-population, synthetic child mortality across multiple time periods.

## Overview

**pssst** is an open-source R package containing functions to fit parametric survival models to survey data to estimate finite-population, synthetic child mortality across multiple time periods. 

The package currently supports the following types of survival data:

* Interval-censored
* Right-censored

The package currently supports the following parametric distributions:

* Weibull
      
Details can be found in the functions `fit_u5mr`, `fit_binary`, and `fit_normal`, respectively.

Current functions available that apply benchmarking methods to samples from a distribution include:

* `benchmark_sampler`: Fully Bayesian benchmarking via a rejection sampler, described in [Okonek and Wakefield, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12195)

* `benchmark_bayesest`: Constrained Bayes estimate approach to benchmarking, described in [Datta et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11749-010-0218-y)

## Installation

The current development version can be installed using `devtools::install_github()`:

```R
