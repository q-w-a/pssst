\title{Formats DHS survey data in appropriate form for parametric survival model for synthetic children.}
\usage{
format_dhs(
  df,
  survey_year,
  period_boundaries,
  right_censor_time = NA,
  intervals = NA,
  strata = c("v023", "v024", "v025")[1]
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe containing a births recode file from DHS, read into R beforehand using
\code{readstata13::read.dta13}}

\item{survey_year}{the (numeric) year of the DHS survey. If survey spand multiple years,
enter the latest one}

\item{period_boundaries}{a numeric vector containing the years surrounding each time period of interest.
Example: if periods are 2000-2005 and 2005-2010, \code{period_boundaries} should be \code{c(2000,2005,2010)}.}

\item{right_censor_time}{age in months at which every individual who was not yet died
should be right-censored. If there is no such age, set equal to NA. If estimating U5MR,
consider setting to 60.}

\item{intervals}{an optional character vector specifying any specific intervals in which
observations should be censored. For example, to interval censor people between ages 6 and 18
months, \code{intervals = c("6-18")}. Intervals cannot overlap (i.e. can't have 6-18, 12-20).}

\item{strata}{a string vector containing which column in \code{df} contains the strata
information. Can be multiple columns. Defaults to "v023".}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the births recode in a format that can be input to \code{surv_synthetic}.
}
\description{
