\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe containing the output from \code{format_dhs}, or optionally, dataframe
containing the following columns}

\item{individual}{column corresponding to individual ID in \code{df}}

\item{household}{column corresponding to household ID in \code{df}}

\item{cluster}{column corresponding to cluster ID in \code{df}}

\item{strata}{column corresponding to strata ID in \code{df}}

\item{weights}{column corresponding to weights in \code{df}}

\item{p}{column corresponding to period ID (numeric) in \code{df}}

\item{a_pi}{column corresponding to child's age at beginning of time period in \code{df}}

\item{l_p}{column corresponding to length of time period in \code{df}}

\item{I_i}{column corresponding to indicator for interval censoring in \code{df}. Should be 1 if
child is interval-censored, 0 if right-censored.}

\item{A_i}{column corresponding to indicator for if a child is interval-censored across the
boundary of a time period in \code{df}}

\item{t_i}{column corresponding to age at right-censoring, if right-censored, in \code{df}}

\item{t_0i}{column corresponding to lower bound of interval, if interval-censored, in \code{df}}

\item{t_1i}{column corresponding to upper bound of interval, if interval-censored, in \code{df}}

\item{only_scale}{boolean for varying only the scale parameter across time period. Defaults to
\code{FALSE}. This option is only available for dist = "weibull"}

\item{dist}{distribution. Currently supports "weibull", "exponential"}

\item{numerical_grad}{boolean for whether gradient should be calculated numerically or
analytically. Analytical gradient is faster, but only available for Weibull and Exponential distributions
at the moment.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item result: a dataframe of summarized results
order arrange(time). Each matrix will have rows arranged in order arrange(region).
\item optim: the output from \code{optim}
\item grad: the gradient evaluated at the MLE
\item variance: the finite population variance-covariance matrix
\item design: the survey design object
\item runtime: runtime for likelihood optimization

\description{
Fits a parametric survival model to DHS data (formatted from \code{format_dhs}) to get survey-weighted
parameter estimates and finite population variances for parametric survival curves in each time period.
